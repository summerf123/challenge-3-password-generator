# challenge-3-password-generator

## App Description

this app is designed to generate a random password for a user. It asks the user how long they want their password to be and what types of characters they would like to include in their password, such as special characters, uppercase, lowercase and numbers. The user has to select the length by inputting the value in the prompt, no less than 8 characters, and no more than 128, and include (say 'OK') at least one type of special character.
